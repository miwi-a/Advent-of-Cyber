We changed the text in the string $a as shown in the eicaryara rule we wrote, from X5O to X50, that is, we replaced the letter O with the number 0. The condition for the Yara rule is $a and $b and $c and $d. If we are to only make a change to the first boolean operator in this condition, what boolean operator shall we replace the 'and' with, in order for the rule to still hit the file?

Change the Yara rule value for the $a string to X50. Rerun the command, but this time with the -c option. What is the result?
