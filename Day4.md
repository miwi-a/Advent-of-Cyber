Authentication can be proven using a variety of authentication means, including:</p><ol><li>A known set of credentials to the server and user such as a username and password<br></li><li>Token authentication (these are unique pieces of encrypted text)<br></li><li>Biometric authentication (fingerprints, retina data, etc.)</li></ol><p><span style="font-size:1rem"><br></span></p><p class="Ubuntu"><span style="font-size:1rem">Authentication is often used interchangeably with authorisation, but it is very different. Authorisation is a term for the rules defining what an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bolder;font-size:1rem">authenticated</span><span style="font-size:1rem">&nbsp;user can and cannot access. For example, a standard, the authenticated user will only be allowed access to some aspects of a website. An authenticated administrator will be able to access the entire thing – their level of authorisation determines this.</span></p><p class="Ubuntu">Authentication is used when there is a necessity to know who is accessing pieces of data or information to create accountability – protecting the&nbsp;<i>Confidentiality</i>&nbsp;element of the CIA triad. If you wish to learn more about this, I recommend checking out the&nbsp;<i>Principles of Security room on TryHackMe</i>. You can find examples of authentication in the real world, for example, a badge or key-card to access restricted places within a building.</p><p class="Ubuntu">&nbsp;</p><h1>What is Fuzzing?</h1><p class="Ubuntu">Put simply, fuzzing is an automated means of testing an element of a web application until the application gives a vulnerability or valuable information. When we are fuzzing, we provide information as we would typically when interacting with it, just at a much faster rate. This means that we can use extensive lists known as wordlists to test a web application’s response to various information.</p><p class="Ubuntu"></p><p class="Ubuntu">For example, rather than testing a login form for a valid set of credentials one-by-one (which is exceptionally time-consuming), we can use a tool for fuzzing this login form to test hundreds of credentials at a much faster rate and more reliably.</p><p class="Ubuntu"></p><p class="Ubuntu">&nbsp;</p><h1>Fuzzing with Burp Suite</h1><p>Please note that this task presumes that you are using the TryHackMe AttackBox.

However, as the username is already known (i.e.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bolder">cmnatic</span>), we are just brute-forcing the password.

**Answer the questions below**
  
1.) Access the login form at http://MACHINE_IP

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95479102/144713090-ff7b1965-ae15-4d16-b1d2-40129b2f70c7.png)

2.) Configure Burp Suite & Firefox, submit some dummy credentials and intercept the request. Use intruder to attack the login form.

Since I have everything set up already on my machine, I skipped some parts. But in case you havent configured Burp Suite and Foxy Proxy there's a guide above.

What I did was, I just tried to input some random credentials just for the sake of getting the request on burp.

I just intercepted the request and sent it to intruder, from then we can set the positions, for this case the username was already a given "santa". So what I did is just select the password and then Add$ position from there I went to payload to set the wordlists that I will be using, which was given above.

3.) What valid password can you use to access the "santa" account?

After running the payload, I was able to verify that the password for santa's account is **cookie** as you can see it is the only password that has response 302 (Found).

4.) What is the flag in Santa's itinerary?

Since we already have santa's credentails I proceeded on logging in and a flag was shown on the homepage.
